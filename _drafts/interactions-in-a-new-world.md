People to people, and people to machine interactions are ever changing, always evolving in order to optimise the communication efficiency. This essay briefs on these interactions in the past, and explores the upcoming new ways of interacting with advances in technology.

## Old world interactions

Until the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, people to people communication was only face to face, in person. With the invention of telephone, remote speech communication became possible over the wire. The modern people to machine interaction became prevalent only with the advent of personal computers towards the last quarter of 20<sup>th</sup> century. Interpersonal communication took a leap when internet was invented in 1980s. However, it was not until the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century that technology advances propelled people to people, and people to machine interactions.

## Mid world interactions

With the arrival of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the computer and internet technologies improved. The personal computer or PC and laptop hardware increased, the Operating System or the OS evolved, and the browsers became faster. Along with this, new technologies emerged such as smart mobile and wi-fi. These catapulted people to people comunications to a new era and lead to explosion of online social applications of technology. Social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter flourished with people getting hooked to these newly found ways of interaction. Chat platforms such as WhatsApp, Snaphat, and WeChat connected people like never before. Community video platforms such as YouTube started maturing. The biggest impact in combination of people to people and people to machine interaction was getting seen in gaming with games such as Fortnite. However, with the new technologies in development, the new world is yet to see exciting new ways of interactions.
