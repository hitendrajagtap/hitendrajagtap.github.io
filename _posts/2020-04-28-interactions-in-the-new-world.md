People to people, and people to machine interactions are ever changing, always evolving to optimise the communication efficiency. This essay briefs on these interactions in the past and explores the upcoming new ways of interacting with advances in technology.

## Interactions in the past

Until the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, people to people communication was only face to face, in person. With the invention of telephone, remote speech communication became possible over the wire. The modern people to machine interaction became prevalent only with the advent of personal computers towards the last quarter of 20<sup>th</sup> century. Interpersonal communication took a leap when internet was invented in 1980s. However, it was not until the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century that technology advances propelled people to people, and people to machine interactions.

## Interactions in the present

With the arrival of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the computer and internet technologies improved. The personal computer or PC and laptop hardware increased, the Operating System or the OS evolved, and the browsers became faster. Along with this, new technologies emerged such as smart mobile and wi-fi. These catapulted people to people communications to a new era and lead to explosion of online social applications of technology. Social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter flourished with people getting hooked to these newly found ways of interaction. Chat platforms such as WhatsApp, Snapchat, and WeChat connected people like never before. Community video platforms such as YouTube started maturing. TV gave way to online streaming platforms such as Netflix. A big impact was seen in gaming with combination of people to people and people to machine interaction in games such as Fortnite. However, with a plethora of new technologies in development currently, the new world is yet to see exciting new ways of interactions.

## Interactions in the new world

I am really excited about the new technologies being developed. They are going to make people to people, and people to machine interactions like never imagined before! A new kind of interactions are also coming into play - machine to machine interactions.

So, what exciting new technologies are we talking about? To begin with, chat bots are evolving messaging apps to a new level. There are bots for different purposes such as memes, music, game bots, and serious customer service and payment bots as well. Technology such as big data has increased our capacity to analyse user behaviours to speed up innovation. As a result, new technologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling smarter interactions. AI is also powering robots. Robots are now getting closer to interacting with people face to face with prototypes being developed in hospitality and medical industries. One other technology that is making people to machine, and machine to machine interactions leapfrog is image recognition, or computer vision. Apart from precise and fast facial recognition, object detection is also getting enhanced. Industrial engineering, construction, and entertainment industries are finding innovative uses of exciting new technologies such as mixed reality (MR), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). Using computer vision, autonomous or self-driving cars are being tested out in real world as we speak. Another evolving technology that will transform machine to machine interactions is 5G, which will enable internet of things (IoT). IoT will take day to day interactions to a whole new level. Few upcoming people to machine interactions are really exciting. Human controlled drones are getting used for various innovative applications. Flying cars and commercial space travel is being talked about in near future.

As you see, the interactions are going to explode giving way to new possibilities in the new world. Here, I have just mentioned the new technologies fuelling these interactions. It is not possible to talk about them in one blog post. Also, there are enabling technologies such as cloud technologies and electronics hardware which I have not touched here. Going forward, I will try to delve in detail about technologies that I am working on, the nuts and bolts of the larger pieces, that we all work on to enable these interactions, one step at a time.
